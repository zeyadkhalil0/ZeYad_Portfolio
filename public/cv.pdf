# This is a placeholder for the CV PDF file
# In a real implementation, you would place the actual CV PDF file here
# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors

# To add the actual CV:
# 1. Save your CV as a PDF file named "cv.pdf"
# 2. Place it in the public folder
# 3. The download functionality will work automatically
